## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
1. TikTok
    - can favorite different videos and put them into collections
    - sending videos and stickers to friends in a group
2. Instagram
    - hidden messages in dms
    - stories
3. Pinterest
    - relevant pins show up under current one
    - easy to make boards/save pins in groups

## Ideas:
  - finding nearby restaurants that fit dietary restrictions
    - rating system with users
    - full menu to parse through
    - interactive map
    - search by distance/ratings

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
-> understanding how to create a repo with a project that's already built
